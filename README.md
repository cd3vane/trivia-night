# Topic - Jeopardy Style Trivia Game
# Description
Our group plans on creating a Jeopardy-style trivia game where the players compete to answer trivia questions correctly. One user will either start a default game or create a custom game. A default game will utilize pre-loaded categories and questions while a custom game will allow the user to input their own categories and questions. The game will use a GUI to present the game board and the player currently in control will be able to pick the next question by clicking on it at which point the question will be displayed allowing the players to attempt to be the first person to ring-in to answer the question. The other players will have a chance as well if the first player fails to answer correctly. Points are earned or lost based on correct and incorrect answers. This is going to be a desktop application that will be able to run on any OS that has Java installed.
